## What is Tankman?

![Tankman](tankman-ai.png)

Many SaaS apps need a way to store organizations, users, roles, permissions and to authorize access. Tankman manages all of these, and comes with a simple REST API. It is MIT licensed, [Open Source](https://github.com/lesser-app/tankman), downloadable as a binary, and uses PostgreSQL as the database.

Tankman is NOT an Identity and Authentication server. But it can play well with Open Source solutions like [Ory Kratos](https://github.com/ory/kratos), various OAuth based providers, or your own custom authentication mechanism.

## What can it do?

- Manage organizations, roles, users, resources and permissions
- Assign roles to users
- Assign user permissions and role permissions to various resources
- Attach properties to Orgs, Roles, Users and query them

## Why not umm... say Google Zanzibar, Auth0 etc?

Tankman is for startups who want a self-hosted, lightweight solution. It provides basic primitives for authorization; which is more often than not what you'll need.

To see how Tankman should be deployed, see [Deploying Tankman](https://example.com).

## It's an early Beta

Tankman is quite new and you might find a few issues. We expect to iron out them out over the next few months and release the first version in Q4 2023. We'll need help - you're invited to [join us on GitHub](https://github.com/lesser-app/tankman).
