# Roadmap

## Tankman v1.0.0

- Beta 1 (July 2023) 
- Beta 2 maybe (August 2023) 
- Release Candidate (September 2023) 
- Final Release (November 2023)
- Switch Native AOT (Jan 2024)

 Tankman is currently built with .Net Framework 8.0 pre-release versions (RTM release in November 2023).
 
 We chose .Net 8.0 because:
 - Long Term Support
 - Better compile-time correctness guarantees
 - Ability to compile to native binaries


## Help Wanted

1. Test Suite. We need to build a full test suite. This is our highest priority item.

2. Clean upthe Documentation

3. Document patterns to use for Authorization.
