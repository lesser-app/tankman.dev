## What is Tankman?

![Tankman](tankman-ai.png)

Tankman is a valuable tool for SaaS applications that require storage for organizations, users, roles, permissions, and access authorization. It offers a user-friendly REST API and is an [open-source solution](https://github.com/lesser-app/tankman) available on GitHub under the MIT license. Users can easily download it as a binary, and it utilizes PostgreSQL as its underlying database.

It's important to note that Tankman does not function as an Identity and Authentication server. However, it seamlessly integrates with popular open-source solutions such as [Ory Kratos](https://github.com/ory/kratos), various OAuth-based providers, or even your own custom authentication mechanism.

## What can it do?

- Manage organizations, roles, users, resources and permissions
- Assign roles to users
- Assign user permissions and role permissions to various resources
- Attach custom properties to Orgs, Roles, Users and query them

## Why not umm... say Google Zanzibar, Auth0 etc?

Tankman is designed for startups that prefer a self-hosted, lightweight solution. It provides essential primitives for authorization, which are often sufficient for most use cases.

## It's an early Beta

Tankman is relatively new, so you might encounter a few issues. We expect to iron them out over the next few months and plan to release the first version in Q4 2023. We welcome your help and invite you to [join us on GitHub](https://github.com/lesser-app/tankman).
